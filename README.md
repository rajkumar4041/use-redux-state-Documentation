## üîß Key Concepts Demonstrated

### State Management Patterns

- **Simple State**: Basic counters and toggles
- **Complex Objects**: User profiles, forms, and settings
- **Arrays**: Todo lists, shopping carts, and product catalogs
- **Nested State**: Theme configurations and user preferences

### Hook Usage

- `useReduxState`: Full state management with setters and utilities
- `useReduxStateSelector`: Derived state and computed values
- `useReduxStateValue`: Read-only state access
- `useMultipleGlobalStates`: Bulk state access

### Advanced Features

- **Partial Updates**: Using the `update` method for object state
- **Reset Functionality**: Resetting state to initial values
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with interfaces
- **Performance**: Memoized selectors and optimized re-renders

## üé® UI Components

The examples showcase various UI patterns:

- **Cards and Grids**: Product displays and statistics
- **Forms**: Complex form management with validation
- **Lists**: Todo items and shopping cart items
- **Controls**: Buttons, inputs, and interactive elements
- **Progress Indicators**: Form completion and loading states

## üì± Responsive Design

All examples are fully responsive and work on:

- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

The layout adapts automatically to different screen sizes.

## üîç Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency
- **Modern React**: Uses latest React patterns and hooks
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized, maintainable code

## üöÄ Performance Features

- **Memoized Selectors**: Efficient derived state calculations
- **Optimized Re-renders**: Components only update when necessary
- **Lazy Loading**: Examples load on demand
- **Efficient State Updates**: Minimal re-renders with smart updates
